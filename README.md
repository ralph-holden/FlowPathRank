Allosteric drug targets present new opportunities for drug discovery. However, the allosteric mechanism
is still not well understood. In this work, a theoretical framework to describe allosteric pathways with
thermodynamics is proposed. Computational approaches are developed to search for and score
pathways that optimise the graph-theoretical free energy. These methods are combined into a workflow
and benchmarked on alternative approaches and the theoretical understanding. Bridging theoretical
and practical, computational predictions are evaluated with experimental data.
